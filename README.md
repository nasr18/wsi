# Script Execution

This project provides several scripts that can be executed using the npm (Node Package Manager) command-line tool. The scripts are defined in the `package.json` file. Below are the available scripts:

- **start**: Starts the server by running the `server.ts` file using the `ts-node` TypeScript execution engine. This script is typically used in production environments.
- **start:dev**: Starts the server by running the `server.ts` file using the `ts-node-dev` TypeScript execution engine which restarts a process when any of the required files change. This script is typically used in development environments.
  - **--respawn**: Keep watching for changes after the script has exited.
  - **src/server.ts**: This is the application's entry file.

To execute a script, open a terminal or command prompt in the project's root directory and run the following command:

   ```shell
  npm run <script-name>
```


Replace `<script-name>` with the name of the script you want to execute. For example, to start the server, run:

   ```shell
  npm run start (or) npm run start:dev
```
